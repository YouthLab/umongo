** Download **

All binaries are available from:
- http://www.edgytech.com/umongo

** Install **

Windows:

- place archive file where is preferred (for example, in your downloads folder)
- extract the archive (right-click “Extract All”)
- open the extracted folder and double-click umongo (type Application)

Linux:

- place archive file where is preferred (for example, in your downloads folder)
- extract the archive (right-click “Extract Here”)
- open the extracted folder and double-click launch-umongo.sh, or execute launch-umongo.sh in a terminal

Mac OSX:

- place archive file where is preferred and extract it (for example, in your downloads folder)
- extract the archive (double-click the file)
- open the extracted folder and double-click umongo.app

If you Mac tells you that the application is damaged, you can try a few things:

- go to "system preferences / security and privacy / General"
Make sure that "allow applications downloaded from" is set to "anywhere".

- It could also be that you have a case-sensitive file system.
Run "diskutil list /" from the command line and see if it says case-sensitive.

One workaround is to right-click on the file, select Show Package Contents, then go to Contents -> Resources -> Java.
Then, just open using jar. You can make an alias to this for easy access if you want.

** Compile **

Right now, you can only compile the app using the netbeans project, which should be improved soon.
