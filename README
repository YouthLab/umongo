** Download **

All binaries are available from:
- http://www.edgytech.com/umongo

** Install and Run **

Windows:

- place archive file where is preferred (for example, in your downloads folder)
- extract the archive (right-click “Extract All”)
- open the extracted folder and double-click umongo (type Application)

Linux:

- place archive file where is preferred (for example, in your downloads folder)
- extract the archive (right-click “Extract Here”)
- open the extracted folder and double-click launch-umongo.sh, or execute launch-umongo.sh in a terminal

Mac OSX:

- place archive file where is preferred and extract it (for example, in your downloads folder)
- extract the archive (double-click the file)
- open the extracted folder and double-click umongo.app

If you Mac tells you that the application is damaged, you can try a few things:

- go to "system preferences / security and privacy / General"
Make sure that "allow applications downloaded from" is set to "anywhere".

- It could also be that you have a case-sensitive file system.
Run "diskutil list /" from the command line and see if it says case-sensitive.

One workaround is to right-click on the file, select Show Package Contents, then go to Contents -> Resources -> Java.
Then, just open using jar. You can make an alias to this for easy access if you want.

** Using a Proxy **

Often times your client machine cannot directly connect to the MongoDB hosts.
One easy trick is to use an SSH tunnel to connect you client (A) to the mongo server (B):
$ ssh -L portOnA:localhost:portOnB -i key.pem hostB -N

For Example:
$ ssh -L 37017:localhost:27017 -i key.pem mongohost.example.com -N
Then you would point the GUI to "localhost:37017".

This also works to go through an intermediate host (B) to the mongo server (C):
$ ssh -L portOnA:hostC:portOnC -i key.pem hostB -N

Note that in this case only the connection to the primary mongod / mongoS will be supported.

** Compile **

Right now, you can only compile the app using the netbeans project, which should be improved soon.
